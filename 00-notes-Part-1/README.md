javaScript is a high-level (we don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management),
object-oriented (based on objects, for storing most kinds of data),
multi-paradigm (different styles of programming)
programming language (instruct computer to do things)

What is the role in web development

three core technologies of the web:

    1. HTML -> Content (text, images, buttons) of the page
    2. CSS - > Presentation of the content (Styling / laying out the elements on a webpage)
    3. JavaScript -> programming langues of the internet

Above three technologies work together to create websites

Re-cap:
linked a javaScript file to an XTML file, and ran it in the browser

objects and primitives

let me = {
name: 'James'

};

primitives

let firstName = "Jonas";
let age = 30;

7 primitive data types:

    1. Number. Floating point numbers -> Used ofr decimals and integers let age = 23;
    2. Strings: Sequence of characters -> Used for text let firstName = "James";
    3. Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false -> used for taking decisions let ageOfMajority = true;
    ==============================================================================================================
    4. undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not defined("empty value) let children;
    5. Null: also means "empty value:
    6. Symbol: value that is unique and cannot be changed
    7. BigInt: Larger integers than the number type can hold
